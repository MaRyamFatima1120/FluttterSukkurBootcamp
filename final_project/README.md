# Coffee App - Final Project

Hello,EveryOne
I hope youâ€™re all doing well. This repository contains the final project for the Flutter Sukkur Bootcamp.

## Project Overview

This project is a coffee app developed as the final assignment for the Flutter Sukkur Bootcamp. The project involves creating a mobile application with a combination of static and dynamic screens as per the specifications provided.

### Screen Requirements

1. **First Three Screens:**
   - These screens are static and are built based on the Figma design.
   - No interactivity is implemented on these screens; they serve to replicate the design accurately.

2. **Fourth Screen:**
   - This screen fetches and displays coffee data dynamically from an API.
   - **API URL:** [https://fake-coffee-api.vercel.app/api](https://fake-coffee-api.vercel.app/api)
   - **Data to Fetch:**
     - `name`
     - `description`
     - `image_url`
     - `price`
   - The fetched data is displayed on the mobile screen using a `ListView.builder`.

### Figma Design

The UI design for the first three screens is based on the following Figma design:
